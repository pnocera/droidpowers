# Droidpowers Comprehensive Migration Design

## Overview
Phased migration strategy for remaining 18 superpowers skills with quality-focused implementation approach.

## Skill Inventory and Classification

### Phase 1: Core Development Skills (Weeks 1-3)
**Purpose:** Essential workflows used daily by developers
**Skills (5):**
1. `systematic-debugging` - Four-phase bug investigation framework
2. `verification-before-completion` - Pre-commit validation and quality gates  
3. `requesting-code-review` - Post-development review initiation
4. `receiving-code-review` - Feedback incorporation workflow
5. `writing-plans` - Detailed implementation plan creation

### Phase 2: Advanced Workflows (Weeks 4-6)
**Purpose:** Complex multi-step development processes
**Skills (5):**
6. `using-git-worktrees` - Isolated feature development workflow
7. `subagent-driven-development` - Independent task execution with review checkpoints
8. `executing-plans` - Controlled batch implementation with validation
9. `finishing-a-development-branch` - Integration completion workflows
10. `condition-based-waiting` - Eliminates flaky tests through condition polling

### Phase 3: Specialized Skills (Weeks 7-9)
**Purpose:** Domain-specific and meta-skills
**Skills (8):**
11. `testing-anti-patterns` - Test quality and mocking best practices
12. `testing-skills-with-subagents` - RED-GREEN-REFACTOR for skill development
13. `root-cause-tracing` - Systematic bug backward investigation
14. `defense-in-depth` - Multi-layer validation and data sanitization
15. `writing-skills` - TDD approach to skill creation
16. `sharing-skills` - Community contribution workflows
17. `using-superpowers` - Meta-skill for skill discovery and usage
18. `dispatching-parallel-agents` - Parallel investigation and problem-solving
