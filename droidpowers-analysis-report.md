5. **testing-skills-with-subagents** - Meta-skill for skill validation
6. **sharing-skills** - Contribution workflow missing

**❌ Missing Command Implementations:**
- Several superpowers commands lack Factory AI equivalents
- Some advanced command patterns not implemented

## Logical Consistency Assessment: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Excellent)

### Workflow Integration Logic

**Gateway Pattern Implementation:**
- ✅ **Excellent design** with using-droids and skill-checker as mandatory entry points
- ✅ Routing logic properly enforces mandatory skill usage
- ✅ Prevents workflow skipping through intelligent analysis

**Skill Dependencies:**
- ✅ All required skill integrations properly documented
- ✅ Cross-skill dependencies maintained (TDD → debugging, etc.)
- ✅ Workflow sequences logically sound

**Command ↔ Droid Mapping:**
- ✅ **Perfect 1:1 mapping** between slash commands and droids
- ✅ Command implementations accurately invoke corresponding droids
- ✅ All 14 commands properly implemented

### Factory AI Integration Logic

**CLI System Integration:**
- ✅ Proper use of Factory AI's `/droid` command system
- ✅ Compatible with Factory AI's skill and agent patterns
- ✅ Follows Factory AI documentation patterns

**Model and Tool Configuration:**
- ✅ Appropriate model selection (claude-sonnet-4-5)
- ✅ Proper tool configuration for each droid
- ✅ MCP tool integration where appropriate

## Quality Enhancement Analysis

### Added Value Beyond Original

**Enhanced Features:**
- ✅ **Gateway system** improves discoverability and compliance
- ✅ **Command aliases** (`/tdd`, `/debug`) improve usability
- ✅ **Project configuration** via AGENTS.md enhances customization
- ✅ **Batch sizing intelligence** in executing-plans
- ✅ **Advanced analytics** in subagent-driven-development

**Documentation Improvements:**
- ✅ **CLAUDE.md integration** for future Claude instances
- ✅ **Quick reference** commands and patterns
- ✅ **Example workflows** for common scenarios

### Risk Assessment

**Potential Issues:**
- ⚠️ **Over-engineering** in some advanced droids (subagent-driven-development)
- ⚠️ **Missing dependencies** could break required workflows
- ⚠️ **Enhanced complexity** may impact adoption

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Critical)
