# Project Skills Configuration

## Project Overview
**Project Type:** [React/Node.js/Python/etc]
**Primary Language:** [JavaScript/TypeScript/Python/etc]
**Build System:** [npm/yarn/pip/etc]

## Mandatory Skills
- **using-droids**: Must run first for task analysis and droid discovery
- **test-driven-development**: All feature implementation and bug fixes
- **verification-before-completion**: Before any commits or pull requests
- **systematic-debugging**: For any bug investigation or unexpected behavior

## Recommended Skills (Core)
- **brainstorming**: For new features, architecture changes, complex implementations
- **writing-plans**: For multi-step tasks and major features
- **requesting-code-review**: After completing significant work items
- **receiving-code-review**: When evaluating feedback on your work
- **using-git-worktrees**: For feature development and experimental work
- **executing-plans**: For batch execution of planned tasks

## Advanced Skills (Specialized)
- **condition-based-waiting**: For eliminating flaky tests and race conditions
- **defense-in-depth**: For data validation and security implementations
- **writing-skills**: For creating new droids and process documentation
- **subagent-driven-development**: For parallel task execution and independent verification

## Workflow Rules
1. **Always use using-droids first** for task analysis and droid discovery
2. **Follow skill-checker recommendations** for mandatory skills
3. **Use indicated skills** for corresponding work types  
4. **Complete all checklists** before proceeding to next step
5. **Validate completion** before marking work as done
6. **Document designs** before implementation
7. **Create TodoWrite todos** for all checklist items

## Build Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
[install-command]

# Run tests
[test-command]

# Build project
[build-command]

# Lint code
[lint-command]
```

## Architecture
### Directory Structure
```
[describe key directories and their purposes]
```

### Key Components
- [Component 1]: [purpose and location]
- [Component 2]: [purpose and location]
- [Component 3]: [purpose and location]

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** [location and framework]
- **Integration Tests:** [location and framework]  
- **End-to-End Tests:** [location and framework]
- **Coverage Target:** [percentage or requirement]

## Development Workflow
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Use test-driven-development for implementation
3. Run verification-before-completion before commits
4. Create pull request with code-reviewer
5. Address feedback and iterate

## Team Conventions
- **Commit Format:** [conventional commits or other format]
- **Branch Naming:** [pattern for feature branches]
- **Code Style:** [linter config, formatting rules]
- **Documentation:** [where and how to document]
