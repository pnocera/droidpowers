# Project Skills Configuration

## Project Overview
**Project Type:** [React/Node.js/Python/etc]
**Primary Language:** [JavaScript/TypeScript/Python/etc]
**Build System:** [npm/yarn/pip/etc]

## Mandatory Skills
- **test-driven-development**: All feature implementation and bug fixes
- **verification-before-completion**: Before any commits or pull requests
- **systematic-debugging**: For any bug investigation or unexpected behavior

## Recommended Skills
- **brainstorming**: For new features, architecture changes, complex implementations
- **writing-plans**: For multi-step tasks and major features
- **code-reviewer**: After completing significant work items
- **using-git-worktrees**: For feature development and experimental work

## Workflow Rules
1. **Always check skill-checker** before starting any task
2. **Use indicated skills** for corresponding work types  
3. **Complete all checklists** before proceeding to next step
4. **Validate completion** before marking work as done
5. **Document designs** before implementation

## Build Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
[install-command]

# Run tests
[test-command]

# Build project
[build-command]

# Lint code
[lint-command]
```

## Architecture
### Directory Structure
```
[describe key directories and their purposes]
```

### Key Components
- [Component 1]: [purpose and location]
- [Component 2]: [purpose and location]
- [Component 3]: [purpose and location]

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** [location and framework]
- **Integration Tests:** [location and framework]  
- **End-to-End Tests:** [location and framework]
- **Coverage Target:** [percentage or requirement]

## Development Workflow
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Use test-driven-development for implementation
3. Run verification-before-completion before commits
4. Create pull request with code-reviewer
5. Address feedback and iterate

## Team Conventions
- **Commit Format:** [conventional commits or other format]
- **Branch Naming:** [pattern for feature branches]
- **Code Style:** [linter config, formatting rules]
- **Documentation:** [where and how to document]
